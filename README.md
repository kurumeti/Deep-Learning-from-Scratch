# Deep-Learning
Dataset's  implementation on Deep Learning Models

Deep learning is a machine learning technique that teaches computers to do what comes naturally to humans: learn by example.
In deep learning, a computer model learns to perform classification tasks directly from images, text, or sound. 
Deep learning models can achieve state-of-the-art accuracy, sometimes exceeding human-level performance. 
Models are trained by using a large set of labeled data and neural network architectures that contain many layers.

Most deep learning methods use neural network architectures, which is why deep learning models are often referred to as deep neural networks.

The term “deep” usually refers to the number of hidden layers in the neural network.
Traditional neural networks only contain 2-3 hidden layers, while deep networks can have as many as 150.

Deep learning models are trained by using large sets of labeled data and neural network architectures
that learn features directly from the data without the need for manual feature extraction.

One of the most popular types of deep neural networks is known as convolutional neural networks (CNN or ConvNet).
A CNN convolves learned features with input data, and uses 2D convolutional layers, making this architecture well suited to processing 2D data, such as images

The most basic components are:

Feedforward Neural Network - the most basic building brick.
Convolutional Neural Network - very useful for images.
Recurrent Neural Network -  used to process sequences.
